# Kaktus

Multi services mobile feed reader, specially designed to work offline. Supports [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/), [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/) and [Tiny Tiny Rss](https://tt-rss.org) as a feed aggregators. Works on Sailfish OS & BlackBerry 10 devices.

Kaktus is working in sync mode, so network connectivity is not
required all the time. The significant feature is possibility
to read articles in offline mode, so without a network usage.
In such mode, previously downloaded content of web pages are
displayed from local cache.

Kaktus is an *unofficial* application. It means that it was not developed by Netvibes nor Old Reader team.
